# Game Boy Recompiler - Session 2 Summary

## Overview
Continued debugging and enhancement of the Game Boy dynamic recompiler, implementing missing instructions and creating additional diagnostic tools.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Rotate Instructions ✅
**What:** Six instructions were not implemented (RLA, RRA, RLCA, RRCA, LD (nn), SP, STOP)

**Impact:** These are commonly used in Game Boy ROMs for bit manipulation

**Solution:**
```typescript
// RLCA (Rotate A left, carry bit)
if (mnemonic === 'RLCA') {
  return `const carry = (state.A >> 7) & 1
state.A = ((state.A << 1) | carry) & 0xFF
state.setZ(false)
state.setN(false)
state.setH(false)
state.setC(carry === 1)`
}

// Similar implementations for RLA, RRCA, RRA
// LD (nn), SP stores SP at immediate address
// STOP sets stopped flag
```

**Result:** All Tetris instructions now properly transpile (except 1 invalid data byte)

---

## Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. `find-todos.ts`
Scans all blocks in a ROM to find unimplemented instructions marked with `// TODO:`

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run find-todos tetris.gb
```

**Output Example:**
```
Found 6 unimplemented instruction types:

  RRA                  (2 occurrences)
  RLA                  (1 occurrences)
  INVALID              (1 occurrences)
  ...
```

### 2. `find-invalid.ts`
Locates invalid/unknown opcodes and shows their context

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run find-invalid tetris.gb
```

**Output Example:**
```
Found INVALID/UNKNOWN at 0x03a6
  Mnemonic: INVALID
  Opcode: 0xe4
  Block: 0x039b
  
  Context:
   03a4: 77
   03a5: 19
  >03a6: e4   <-- invalid opcode
   03a7: 06
```

## Performance Results

### Tetris (10M cycles)
- **Execution Time:** 76ms
- **Performance:** 131.58 MHz
- **Speedup:** 31.40x vs real hardware (4.19 MHz)
- **Cache Hit Rate:** 96.15%
- **Blocks Compiled:** 17,866
- **Blocks Executed:** 464,443

---

## Analysis of Remaining Issues

### Invalid Opcode 0xE4
- Found at address 0x03A6
- Surrounded by data-like patterns (LD D, n sequences)
- Likely data table misidentified as code during static analysis
- Not executed during runtime (doesn't affect emulation)

### Fallback Execution
Game reaches addresses 0xC000-0xFFFF (RAM) and 0x2800+ which aren't in the static analysis database because:
1. They're targets of indirect jumps (JP (HL))
2. They're dynamically computed addresses
3. They're code copied to RAM at runtime

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement JIT compilation for unknown blocks
- Add runtime block discovery
- Create interpreter fallback that properly executes instructions

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Instruction Pattern Matching
Fixed ordering issue where 16-bit `LD rr, nn` must be checked before 8-bit `LD r, n` to prevent misidentification.

### Comprehensive Testing
Created tools to systematically find and fix missing instructions rather than discovering them through runtime crashes.

## Summary

The dynamic recompiler now:
1. ✅ Implements all common Game Boy instructions
2. ✅ Achieves 31x performance improvement
3. ✅ Maintains 96%+ cache hit rate
4. ✅ Has diagnostic tools for finding issues
5. ✅ Correctly handles LY register reads
6. ✅ Properly manages 16-bit stack pointer

**Next Steps:**
- Implement dynamic block compilation for indirect jumps
- Add interpreter fallback for unknown addresses
- Continue PPU development for graphics
- Test with additional ROMs for compatibility
